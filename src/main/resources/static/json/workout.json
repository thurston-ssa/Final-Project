Also known as Suspended Biceps Curl, arguably somewhat\r\n      of a misnomer.\r\n      \u00a0\r\n      The positioning of arms, with elbows high, places short head\r\n      (medial head) of Bicep Brachii in active\r\n      insufficiency as arm continues to flex. The long head of\r\n      Biceps Brachii (lateral head) and in particular, Brachialis are\r\n      primary movers in this position.\r\n      \u00a0\r\n      Allowing elbows to drop slightly during flexion may somewhat\r\n      decrease active insufficiency of biceps brachii. However, this\r\n      technique may not ideally emphasize biceps' involvement, since\r\n      this position prevents body from achieving a more upright position\r\n      at end of movement at any given initial body angle, thereby creating\r\n      a peak contraction (greatest resistance at top of movement) on\r\n      elbow flexors which enter into yet another related compromised\r\n      mechanical position (see Tension\r\n      Potential and Muscle\r\n      Length-tension Relationship).\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Easier\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Resistance is least when body is positioned upright at top\r\n      of exercise.

With body more angled\r\n      back, stance can be on heels with forefeet pointing upward. At\r\n      higher angles, feet can be placed flat on floor. When angled\r\n      further back, only heels may contact floor with forefeet raising\r\n      upward.

Take care to maintain tension\r\n      on suspension trainer near top of movement. Dismounting can be\r\n      achieved by walking backward until body is upright or stepping\r\n      out at top of movement.\r\n      \u00a0\r\n      This movement may involve more shoulder girdle retraction\r\n      compared to traditional rotator cuff exercises such as Cable\r\n      Shoulder External Rotation, where movement is purely shoulder\r\n      external rotation. However, this movement can be performed more\r\n      'strict' if desired to minimize shoulder girdle movement. Similarly,\r\n      traditional shoulder external rotator work calls for strict 90\u00ba\r\n      elbow positioning. In this exercise utilizing bodyweight, elbow\r\n      angle could be decreased in order to offer appropriate (lighter)\r\n      starting resistance. In any case, attempt to keep elbow angle\r\n      fixed throughout movement.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Easier\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Resistance is least when body is positioned upright, at top\r\n      of exercise. Movement can be made easier with staggered foot\r\n      position by placing one foot slightly back, most commonly performed\r\n      on this exercise. Elbows can be bent more sharply, thereby decreasing\r\n      lever arm length.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Harder\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Elbows can be bent closer to 90\u00b0 (as opposed to being\r\n      bent more sharply), thereby increasing lever arm length (horizontal\r\n      distance from handle to upper arm attached to rotating shoulder).\r\n      This movement can also be made more challenging by placing feet\r\n      more forward, thereby angling body back at initiation of movement.\r\n      See Gravity\r\n      Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences\r\n      resistance.\r\n    \r\n"

		"instructions" : "\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n    Instructions\r\n\r\n    Preparation\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Grasp suspension handle(s) with one hand. Step back until\r\n      handle is chest height when held to side of chest. Facing suspension\r\n      apparatus with feet shoulder width apart, point other arm and\r\n      its shoulder forward, parallel with angle of strap.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Execution\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Rotate body and extended arm, reaching outward while lowering\r\n      body downward by extending arm holding onto handle. Extend arms\r\n      and shoulders in-line with suspension strap so body is angled\r\n      back to one side. Return by raising body back upward in opposite\r\n      motion, reaching outward and toward suspension strap while pulling\r\n      handle back to side of chest until body is upright and arm parallel\r\n      with angle of strap. Repeat and continue with opposite side.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Comments\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Some suspension trainer brands allow independent use of only\r\n      one handle, whereas, more popular brands require either anchoring\r\n      unused handle within stirrup of gripped handle or grasping both\r\n      handles with one hand.\r\n      \u00a0\r\n      External\r\n      hip rotation is seen in lower swinging hip, whereas, internal hip\r\n      rotation is observed in upper anchored hip. Muscles rotating\r\n      hips may arguably be involved in movement, although relative\r\n      intensity appears to be negligible, particularly since forefeet\r\n      are not planted firmly on surface in lower position where hips\r\n      are more rotated, preventing significant torque to be achieved,\r\n      which suggests hip rotation is largely passive.\r\n      \u00a0\r\n      In contrast, a wide base of support with heels apart allows\r\n      allows for adequate torque for spinal\r\n      rotation. However, if hips rotate more than spine, as typically\r\n      performed and as shown, range of motion through waist quite is\r\n      limited.\r\n      \u00a0\r\n      An alternative form is to place feet in-line, perpendicular\r\n      to suspension straps with lower foot forward. This turns pelvis\r\n      90\u00ba, stabilizing hip movement so waist can articulate through\r\n      greater range of motion. Check back for future updates for its\r\n      possible inclusion into ExRx.net Exercise Directory.\r\n      \u00a0\r\n      Some manuals demonstrate Power Pull with high elbow position\r\n      on pulling arm. An elbow positioned at height of shoulder would\r\n      remove lat involvement requiring smaller muscles of upper back\r\n      (ie: rear delt) to be emphasized.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Easier\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Resistance is least when body is positioned upright at top\r\n      of exercise. Movement can be made easier with staggered foot\r\n      position by placing foot opposite of gripping hand slightly back.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Harder\r\n\r\n    \r\n      This movement can be made more challenging by placing feet\r\n      more forward, thereby, angling body back at initiation of movement.\r\n      In which case, stance can be on heels with forefeet pointing\r\n      upward. See Gravity\r\n      Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences\r\n      resistance.\r\n    \r\n"

Momentarily\r\n      step back until arms are extended forward and straight. While\r\n      keeping arms straight and shoulders back, step forward so body\r\n      reclines back behind suspension handle(s). Position body and\r\n      legs straight at desired angle, hanging from handles with arms\r\n      straight. Feet can be either shoulder width or as wide as desired.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Execution\r\n\r\n    \r\n      While keeping arms straight and shoulders fixed, rotate torso\r\n      up to one side. Twist until upright or slight stretch is felt\r\n      in waist, whichever comes soonest. Rotate back to starting position\r\n      and repeat. Continue on opposite side.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Comments\r\n\r\n    \r\n      The exercise can also be mounted from top position in fully\r\n      rotated position facing perpendicular to suspension straps while\r\n      positioning feet parallel to straps. Exercise can also be executed\r\n      by alternating sides, rotating from one side to the other. Dismounting\r\n      can be achieved either at top of movement when body is fully\r\n      rotated or hanging at bottom position by walking backward until\r\n      body is upright.\r\n      \u00a0\r\n      Both arms should be horizontal and straight throughout movement.\r\n      This movement involves both spinal\r\n      rotation and hip rotation. Internal\r\n      Rotation occurs in far hip and External\r\n      Rotation occurs in near hip. Unlike traditional isolated\r\n      spinal rotation exercises, movement is limited, rotating from\r\n      neutral position as opposed from rotating fluidly from one extreme\r\n      to the other. See Spot\r\n      Reduction Myth.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Easier\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Resistance is least when body is positioned upright, at top\r\n      of exercise.

Roll body down and lie with back on ball, hips\r\n      nearly straight, and feet apart on floor. Hold onto stirrup with\r\n      both hands with arms extending straight upward.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Execution\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Allow resistance from cable to turn torso downward, toward\r\n      direction of pulley while keeping arms straight and perpendicular\r\n      to torso throughout movement. Pull stirrup in an arch over shoulders\r\n      by rotating torso to opposite direction of pulley until cable\r\n      makes contact with shoulder.

Because leg furthest from pulley acts to counter\r\n      weight of cable's resistance, greatest downward force onto floor\r\n      is place on foot closest to pulley. Since foot of near leg provides\r\n      more secured base of support, external rotation of near hip provides\r\n      significantly more torque as compared to relatively passive internal\r\n      rotation of far hip.\r\n      \u00a0\r\n      Continued rotation would occur through spine except when\r\n      cable makes contact with body precluding further movement and\r\n      resistance would no longer be provided through cable since line of force is\r\n      no longer perpendicular line of pull. Seated oblique exercises\r\n      or those exercises where hips are stabilized, allow for greater\r\n      range of movement through spine. See Spot\r\n      Reduction Myth.\r\n    \r\n"

Grasp barbell to sides. Dismount bar from\r\n      rack and back up until contact is made with box immediately behind.\r\n      Stand with wide stance with feet flared out slightly.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Execution\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Sit back onto box by bending hips back while bending knees,\r\n      keeping shins nearly perpendicular or knees slightly behind ankles.\r\n      Lower rear end back onto box in controlled manner. Rock torso\r\n      back slightly. Once torso rocks forward, immediately stand back\r\n      up rapidly by driving hips upward, keeping knees above ankles\r\n      and chest high until legs are straight. Return and repeat.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Comments\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Try to keep knees from traveling forward while reaching rear\r\n      end back onto squat box. Ideally, knees could be behind ankles.\r\n      In this position, greater stretch reflex can be created through\r\n      hips (via hamstrings)\r\n      once torso rocks forward just before squat. However, other hip extensors\r\n      can engage in stretch-shortening\r\n      cycle (although to lesser extend in this position) in lieu\r\n      of hamstrings' optimized involvement.\r\n      \u00a0\r\n      Box Squat is said to build explosive strength by breaking\r\n      eccentric/concentric chain as experienced in Barbell\r\n      Squat. However, stretch-shortening cycle still occurs through\r\n      altered exercise mechanics as explained above.\r\n      \u00a0\r\n      Adjustable safety bars on power rack should be positioned\r\n      slightly below lowest position of barbell in case of fail. Box's\r\n      height could allow pivot point of hips to travel slightly lower\r\n      than pivot point of knee, however, programmed partials\r\n      can be performed on higher box. Rubber mats can be stacked on\r\n      top of box to adjust to intended height. Box can be orientated\r\n      diagonally so corners can be straddled, so box is more directly\r\n      under hips in standing position.\r\n      \u00a0\r\n      Do not fall on to or bounce off of box. Keep head facing\r\n      forward, back straight and feet flat on floor. Keep knees apart\r\n      so thighs point same direction as feet throughout movement. Involvement\r\n      of Quadriceps and Soleus are limited since shin is kept nearly\r\n      vertical.\r\n      \u00a0\r\n      During 1960s, Box squats (then called Rocking Box Squats)\r\n      were first popularized by Olympic hammer thrower and power lifter\r\n      George Frenn (Boyle 2010). Box Squats were later popularized\r\n      by Louie Simmons.\r\n      Dozens of variations are used by powerlifters and athletes using\r\n      Louie Simons' Westside\r\n      Barbell Program.\r\n    \r\n"

Squat down\r\n      and grip bar with very wide overhand grip. Position shoulders\r\n      over bar with back arched tightly. Arms are straight with elbows\r\n      pointed along bar.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Execution\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Pull bar up off floor by extending hips and knees. As bar\r\n      reaches knees, back stays arched and maintains same angle to\r\n      floor as in starting position. When barbell passes knees, vigorously\r\n      raise shoulders while keeping bar as close to legs as possible.\r\n      When bar passes upper thighs, allow it to contact thighs. Jump\r\n      upward extending body. Shrug shoulders and pull barbell upward\r\n      with arms, allowing elbows to pull up to sides, keeping them\r\n      over bar as long as possible. Aggressively pull body under bar.\r\n      Catch bar at arm's length while moving into squat position. As\r\n      soon as barbell is caught on locked out arms in squat position,\r\n      squat up into standing position with barbell over head.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Return\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Bend knees slightly and lower barbell to mid-thigh position.\r\n      Slowly lower bar with taut lower back and trunk close to vertical.\r\n      The advanced athlete may unload (drop) bar from completed\r\n      position. This technique may be practiced to reduce stress or\r\n      fatigue involved in lowering bar as prescribed. Use rubber weightlifting\r\n      plates on weightlifting platform if this unloading method is\r\n      used (unless floor demolition is desired).\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Comments\r\n\r\n    \r\n      The snatch is one coordinated, continuous movement executed\r\n      with speed. The grip should be wide enough to allow for full\r\n      squat with bar at arms length over head. Hook\r\n      grip is used by advanced lifters to maintain grip during\r\n      snatch. Do not jerk weight from floor; arise steadily then accelerate.\r\n      The lift is complete when bar is under control over head. also\r\n      known as Squat Snatch.

Squat down and grip bar\r\n      with overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder width. Position\r\n      shoulders over bar with back arched tightly. Arms are straight\r\n      with elbows pointed along bar.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Execution (Power Clean)\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Pull bar up off floor by extending hips and knees. As bar\r\n      reaches knees vigorously, raise shoulders while keeping barbell\r\n      close to thighs. When barbell passes mid-thigh, allow it to contact\r\n      thighs. Jump upward extending body. Shrug shoulders and pull\r\n      barbell upward with arms, allowing elbows to flex out to sides,\r\n      keeping bar close to body. Aggressively pull body under bar,\r\n      rotating elbows around bar. Catch bar on shoulders before knees\r\n      bend lower than 90\u00b0. Stand up immediately so thighs ride\r\n      no lower than parallel to floor.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Execution (Jerk)\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Adjust grip if necessary. Inhale and position chest high\r\n      with torso tight. Keeping pressure on heels, dip body by bending\r\n      knees and ankles slightly. Explosively drive upward with legs,\r\n      driving barbell up off shoulders. Drop body downward and split\r\n      one foot forward and other backward as fast as possible, while\r\n      vigorously extending arms over head. The split position places\r\n      front shin vertical to floor with front foot flat on floor. The\r\n      rear knee is slightly bent with rear foot positioned on toes.\r\n      The bar should be positioned directly over ears at arm's length\r\n      with back straight. Push up with both legs. Position feet side\r\n      by side by bringing front foot back part way and then rear foot\r\n      forward.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Return\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Lower barbell to shoulders, then bend knees slightly and\r\n      lower barbell to mid-thigh position. Slowly lower bar with taut\r\n      lower back and trunk close to vertical. The advanced athlete\r\n      may unload (drop) bar from completed position. This technique\r\n      may be practiced to reduce stress or fatigue involved in lowering\r\n      bar as prescribed.
