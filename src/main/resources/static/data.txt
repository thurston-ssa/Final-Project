While keeping arms straight      and shoulders back, step forward so body is reclined back. Position      palms up or slightly inward.        Execution          Bring handles toward shoulders by flexing arms, while keeping      elbows pointed forward. Return by straightening arms and repeat.        Comments          Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body      is upright. Also known as Suspended Biceps Curl, arguably somewhat      of a misnomer.      \u00a0      The positioning of arms, with elbows high, places short head      (medial head) of Bicep Brachii in active      insufficiency as arm continues to flex. The long head of      Biceps Brachii (lateral head) and in particular, Brachialis are      primary movers in this position.      \u00a0      Allowing elbows to drop slightly during flexion may somewhat      decrease active insufficiency of biceps brachii. However, this      technique may not ideally emphasize biceps' involvement, since      this position prevents body from achieving a more upright position      at end of movement at any given initial body angle, thereby creating      a peak contraction (greatest resistance at top of movement) on      elbow flexors which enter into yet another related compromised      mechanical position (see Tension      Potential and Muscle      Length-tension Relationship).        Easier          Resistance is least when body is positioned upright at top      of exercise. Movement can be made easier with staggered foot      position by placing one foot slightly back.        Harder          Begin in a more reclined position. With body more angled      back, stance can be on heels with forefeet pointing upward. At      higher angles, feet can be placed flat on floor. When angled      further back, only heels may contact floor with forefeet raising      upward. See Gravity      Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences      resistance.    ,

Exercise      may also be performed with shoulder traveling up to 30\u00ba      forward, more inline with plane of scapular.      \u00a0      Supraspinatus activity is similar between 'empty      can' and 'full can' exercises. However, 'full can' results      in less risk of subacromial impingement. Scapular internal rotation      and scapular anterior tilt, both of which decrease subacromial      space width and increase impingement risk, are greater when performing      scaption      with shoulder internal rotation (empty can) compared with scaption      with external rotation (full can).

While keeping arms straight      and shoulders back, step forward so body reclines back behind      suspension handles. Position body and legs straight at desired      angle hanging from handles with arms straight. Internally rotate      shoulders so elbows are positioned directly outwards with arms      straight or slightly bent. Shoulder should be positioned approximately      90\u00b0 relative to torso position.        Execution          Pull handles out to sides while keeping stiff elbow position      and maintaining shoulder at 90\u00b0 plane to torso throughout      exercise. Raise up until upper arms are in-line to one another.      Return to original position in same plane and repeat.        Comments          Upper arms should travel in transverse path at shoulder level      without allowing elbows to drop to minimize Latissimus      Dorsi involvement. A very upright position (ie: very light      resistance) with one foot positioned slightly back (see 'Easier')      is typically required for proper execution. Take care to maintain      tension on suspension trainer near top of movement. Dismounting      can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright or      stepping out at top of movement.        Easier          Resistance is least when body is positioned upright at top      of exercise. Movement can be made easier with staggered foot      position by placing one foot slightly back (as shown), as most      commonly performed in this particular exercises.        Harder          Apart from a regular stance (no staggering feet). This movement      can be made more challenging by placing feet more forward, thereby      angling body back at initiation of movement. In which case, stance      can be on heels with forefeet pointing upward. See Gravity      Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences      resistance.    ,

Maintain elbows      height above wrists by raising \pinkie finger\ side      up. Lower and repeat.        Comments          Dumbbells are raised by shoulder      transverse abduction, not external      rotation, nor extension.      Upper arm should travel in perpendicular path to torso to minimize      relatively powerful latissimus      dorsi involvement. This mean at top of movement, elbows (not      necessarily dumbbells) should be directly lateral to shoulders      since elbows are slightly bent forward. To exercise posterior      deltoid and not lateral Deltoidkeep upper torso close to horizontal.      Positioning upper torso at 45\u00b0 is not sufficient angle to      target rear deltoids. The spine can be flexed to achieve this      positioning if thighs can provide sufficient support for torso.      Some individuals may not be able to bend sufficiently at hip      due to flexibility or girth constraints. Also see Rear      Lateral Raise Errors and Low Back Alignment Exceptions.    ,

Step back until suspension straps are taut. While keeping bent      elbows to side, step forward slightly so body reclines back behind      suspension handles.        Execution          Pull handles apart from each side, while keeping fixed elbow      position and body and legs straight throughout movement. Raise      forward so handles are to each side of body. Return back until      handles come back together in front of body. Repeat.        Comments          A very upright position (ie: very light resistance) with      one foot positioned back slightly (see 'Easier') is typically      required for proper execution. Take care to maintain tension      on suspension trainer near top of movement. Dismounting can be      achieved by walking backward until body is upright or stepping      out at top of movement.      \u00a0      This movement may involve more shoulder girdle retraction      compared to traditional rotator cuff exercises such as Cable      Shoulder External Rotation, where movement is purely shoulder      external rotation. However, this movement can be performed more      'strict' if desired to minimize shoulder girdle movement. Similarly,      traditional shoulder external rotator work calls for strict 90\u00ba      elbow positioning. In this exercise utilizing bodyweight, elbow      angle could be decreased in order to offer appropriate (lighter)      starting resistance. In any case, attempt to keep elbow angle      fixed throughout movement.        Easier          Resistance is least when body is positioned upright, at top      of exercise. Movement can be made easier with staggered foot      position by placing one foot slightly back, most commonly performed      on this exercise. Elbows can be bent more sharply, thereby decreasing      lever arm length.        Harder          Elbows can be bent closer to 90\u00b0 (as opposed to being      bent more sharply), thereby increasing lever arm length (horizontal      distance from handle to upper arm attached to rotating shoulder).      This movement can also be made more challenging by placing feet      more forward, thereby angling body back at initiation of movement.      See Gravity      Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences      resistance.    ,

Position arms downward and slightly forward, nearly parallel      with suspension straps. Lean forward, placing upper body weight      onto handles with arms straight, while stepping back onto forefeet,      so body is leaning forward at desired angle. Straighten body      so torso is in-line with legs. Bend elbows slightly and internally      rotate shoulders, so elbows are pointed outward to each side.        Execution          Lower body by allowing suspension handles to separate outward      until mild stretch is felt in chest. Reverse motion by bringing      handles back together in hugging motion. Repeat.        Comments          See Suspended      Prone Mount/Dismount. Throughout movement, keep elbows in      fixed, slightly bent position and shoulders internally rotated,      so elbows are kept pointed outward and high. Arms and suspension      straps plane of motion should be perpendicular to body. Both      upper and lower body must be kept straight throughout movement.      Angle of body affects difficulty of movement. See Gravity      Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences      resistance. Also known as Suspended Chest Fly. See front      angled view.        Easier          Resistance is least when body is positioned upright, at top      of exercise. Movement can also be made easier with staggered      foot position by placing one foot slightly forward. Elbows can      also become slightly more bent as arms extend further out to      sides.        Harder          This movement can be made more challenging by positioning      body more horizontal at lower position. This can be achieved      by placing feet further back and having handles positioned further      down nearer ground. Elbows can be kept somewhat straighter, particularly      as arms extend further out to sides.    ,

Return to starting position      until chest muscles are stretched. Repeat.        Comments          Under greater resistance, positioning torso at lower angle      downward (by bending over at hips), will allow upper body weight      to counterbalance upward pull of cables, as opposed to stepping      forward and struggling with the backward pull of cables.

Since this movement      becomes more difficult as full shoulder elevation is achieved,      height criteria for shoulder elevation may be needed.

Execution          Raise upper arms to sides until elbows are shoulder height.      Maintain upper arms perpendicular to torso and fixed elbow position      (10\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 angle) throughout exercise. Maintain height      of elbows above wrists by raising \pinkie finger\ side      up. Lower and repeat.        Comments          Dumbbells are raised by shoulder      transverse abduction, not external      rotation, nor extension.      Upper arm should travel in perpendicular path to torso to minimize      relatively powerful latissimus      dorsi involvement. In other words, at top of movement, elbows      (not necessarily dumbbells) should be directly lateral to shoulders      since elbows are slightly bent forward. To exercise posterior      deltoid and not lateral Deltoidkeep torso close to horizontal.      Positioning torso at 45\u00b0 is not sufficient angle to target      rear deltoids. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight      (See Hamstring      Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight      hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not      be positioned as low.

Step back until      handle is chest height when held to side of chest. Facing suspension      apparatus with feet shoulder width apart, point other arm and      its shoulder forward, parallel with angle of strap.        Execution          Rotate body and extended arm, reaching outward while lowering      body downward by extending arm holding onto handle. Extend arms      and shoulders in-line with suspension strap so body is angled      back to one side. Return by raising body back upward in opposite      motion, reaching outward and toward suspension strap while pulling      handle back to side of chest until body is upright and arm parallel      with angle of strap. Repeat and continue with opposite side.        Comments          Some suspension trainer brands allow independent use of only      one handle, whereas, more popular brands require either anchoring      unused handle within stirrup of gripped handle or grasping both      handles with one hand.      \u00a0      External      hip rotation is seen in lower swinging hip, whereas, internal hip      rotation is observed in upper anchored hip. Muscles rotating      hips may arguably be involved in movement, although relative      intensity appears to be negligible, particularly since forefeet      are not planted firmly on surface in lower position where hips      are more rotated, preventing significant torque to be achieved,      which suggests hip rotation is largely passive.      \u00a0      In contrast, a wide base of support with heels apart allows      allows for adequate torque for spinal      rotation. However, if hips rotate more than spine, as typically      performed and as shown, range of motion through waist quite is      limited.      \u00a0      An alternative form is to place feet in-line, perpendicular      to suspension straps with lower foot forward. This turns pelvis      90\u00ba, stabilizing hip movement so waist can articulate through      greater range of motion. Check back for future updates for its      possible inclusion into ExRx.net Exercise Directory.      \u00a0      Some manuals demonstrate Power Pull with high elbow position      on pulling arm. An elbow positioned at height of shoulder would      remove lat involvement requiring smaller muscles of upper back      (ie: rear delt) to be emphasized.        Easier          Resistance is least when body is positioned upright at top      of exercise. Movement can be made easier with staggered foot      position by placing foot opposite of gripping hand slightly back.        Harder          This movement can be made more challenging by placing feet      more forward, thereby, angling body back at initiation of movement.      In which case, stance can be on heels with forefeet pointing      upward. See Gravity      Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences      resistance.    ,

Grasp stirrup with one hand and step back so arm is straight.      With leg of opposite side as loaded arm, plant forefoot far back      on floor. Slightly bend knee of forward leg, same direction as      foot. Allow shoulder with stirrup to be pulled forward with twist      through waist.        Execution          Pull cable attachment to side of torso and rotate body toward      side of pulling arm. Pull shoulder back and push chest forward.      Return until arm is extended and shoulder is pulled forward.      Repeat. Continue with opposite arm.        Comments          In standing position, both spinal rotation and hip rotation      contribute to body's rotation. Because rear leg is only supported      by forefoot, hip of forward leg is utilized (hip internal      rotation / transverse      adduction) much greater than hip of rear leg since forward      leg offers more secured base of support.        Opposite Stance          With the legs in opposite stance, body will be turned more      away from cable resulting in slight difference of muscle involvement      throughout movement.              During movement:                      less spinal        rotation        more hip external        rotators / transverse        abduction (forward/opposite side hip)        less hip internal        rotators / transverse        adduction (rear/same side hip)                    Near end of pull:                      less shoulder        extension        more shoulder        abduction          ,

Attach cable      ankle cuff to ankle, nearest pulley. Place far stationary foot      slightly forward. Grasp lower thigh of leg with attached cuff,      position it along side thigh of stationary leg while keeping      foot slightly above floor.        Execution          Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90\u00b0,      pull cable attachment under thigh of stationary leg by rotating      hip. Return until slight stretch is felt in hip, then repeat.      Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue facing opposite      direction.        Comments          Height of knee on exercising leg may require subtle adjustment      during movement to permit clearance of traveling foot above floor.      Gluteus Maximus will be activated as stabilizer on heavier loads      when participant pushes stationary foot onto floor thereby anchoring      lower body as hip adductors keep thighs together. Upper body      muscles can also assist in keeping thigh of exercising leg along      side stationary leg.      \u00a0      Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive since direction      of rotation is relative to movement of hip, or thigh, not bent      leg.

Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only contract      dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist      flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique act only to stabilize      pelvis and waist during hip flexion. If waist flexion were to      occur after complete hip flexion, resistive forces are no longer      working against abdominal muscles in this final position when      knees and hips are flexed. However, abdominal muscles are activated      isometrically to keep spine straight when knees are not under      body. Also see Spot      Reduction Myth and Lower      Ab Myth.

Keep back against back pad to minimize torso      movement, reducing rotation below cervical spine.      \u00a0      Woven cotton or cloth belts tend to slip less, particularly      on bald heads. If belt slips from head, place small towel between      belt and head. Cable carabiner slips to one side on square buckles      and stresses belts structural integrity under heavy loads. Rounded      buckle is more ideal since it provides more even stress on belt.      Belts not made specifically for weight training may cause injury      if they fail under load in which they were not designed.      \u00a0      Exercise can also be performed off of rack with belt, nylon      rope, and plate holder from wrist roller. Nylon rope offers less      friction on smooth rounded fixed surface. Alternatively, non-nylon      ropes can be used off of revolving barbell sleeve on smith machine.

Momentarily      step back until arms are extended forward and straight. While      keeping arms straight and shoulders back, step forward so body      reclines back behind suspension handle(s). Position body and      legs straight at desired angle, hanging from handles with arms      straight. Feet can be either shoulder width or as wide as desired.        Execution          While keeping arms straight and shoulders fixed, rotate torso      up to one side. Twist until upright or slight stretch is felt      in waist, whichever comes soonest. Rotate back to starting position      and repeat. Continue on opposite side.        Comments          The exercise can also be mounted from top position in fully      rotated position facing perpendicular to suspension straps while      positioning feet parallel to straps. Exercise can also be executed      by alternating sides, rotating from one side to the other. Dismounting      can be achieved either at top of movement when body is fully      rotated or hanging at bottom position by walking backward until      body is upright.      \u00a0      Both arms should be horizontal and straight throughout movement.      This movement involves both spinal      rotation and hip rotation. Internal      Rotation occurs in far hip and External      Rotation occurs in near hip. Unlike traditional isolated      spinal rotation exercises, movement is limited, rotating from      neutral position as opposed from rotating fluidly from one extreme      to the other. See Spot      Reduction Myth.        Easier          Resistance is least when body is positioned upright, at top      of exercise. Movement can be made easier with staggered foot      position by placing near foot (turning side) slightly back.        Harder          This movement can be made more challenging by placing feet      more forward, thereby angling body back at initiation of movement.      See Gravity      Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences      resistance.    ,

Grasp bottom of loops, then lay supine. Raise legs      and place heels in loops with soles contacting handles. Extend      legs out with one leg crossed over other. Turn on side of lower      leg so legs are parallel. Place forearm on mat or floor under      shoulder perpendicular to body.        Execution          Raise hips upward by lateral      flexion of spine. Lower to original position and repeat.      Reposition to opposite side and continue.        Comments          In addition to lateral flexion of spine, lower      hip abducts and upper hip      adducts. More popular suspension trainers allow limited slippage,      so loop around lower leg can be positioned below loop of upper      leg once on side (as shown). Other models can be adjusted, so      strap on lower leg is slightly longer than strap on upper leg.      Also see Spot      Reduction Myth.

Execution          With knees straight, raise legs by flexing hips until hips      are completely flexed. Return until hips and knees are extended.      Repeat.        Comments          Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only contract      dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist      flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act      to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion. It may be necessary      to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible, as      in leg-hip raise. Attempting to perform Incline Straight Leg-Hip      Raise at a low incline would not load waist and hip flexors after      they travel beyond vertical so that sort of movement would need      to be performed on steep incline or vertical position, requiring      much greater strength.

Attach cable      ankle cuff to ankle furthest pulley. Place foot of stationary      leg just forward of foot attached to cable. Grasp bench and handle      bar on cable column if available. Position thighs of both legs      side by side, perpendicular to cable. Raise foot attached to      cable slightly off of floor.        Execution          Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90\u00b0,      pull cable attachment away from pulley by rotating hip as far      as possible. Return foot behind stationary foot and toward pulley.      Repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue facing      opposite direction.        Comments          Height of knee on exercising leg may require subtle adjustment      during movement to permit clearance of traveling foot above floor.      Gluteus Maximus will be activated as stabilizer on heavier loads      when participant pushes stationary foot onto floor, thereby anchoring      lower body as hip abductors keep thighs in place.      \u00a0      Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive since direction      of rotation is relative to movement of hip, or thigh, not bent      leg. For example, in this exercise, internal      rotation of hip causes front of thigh to turn inward despite      bent leg moving outward. Incidentally, if knee was straight during      internal rotation of thigh, foot would move inward.    ,

Comments          Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only contract      dynamically if actual waist flexion occurs.

Lie down supine      on mat so knees and hips are bent with suspension straps hanging      vertical. Place arms off to sides.        Execution          Raise hips up by extending hips until fully extended. Lower      hips until hips and back make contact with mat. Repeat.        Comments          See Suspended      Supine Feet Mount/Dismount. Hamstring enters active      insufficiency as hip is raised since knee is flexed and hip      does not flex beyond 90 degrees. However, it is used more to      stabilize knees in fixed flexed position. Dorsal      flexion of ankle reduces active      insufficiency of Gastrocnemius, allowing it to assist Hamstrings      in maintaining fixed knee flexion. See Knee      flexion abduction force vector diagram. Adductor      Magnus does not assist since hip extension does not occur      in fully flexed position.        Easier          Movement can be made easier by lying closer under anchor      of suspension trainer.

Comments          One of very few body weight exercises that directly exercises      side deltoid in relatively full range of motion. In addition      to lateral flexion of spine, lower      hip abducts and upper hip      adducts. See Spot      Reduction Myth.        Easier          Movement can be made easier by positioning forearm on higher      elevated surface.        Harder          Exercise can be made more challenging by propping forearm      on lower height surface. Exercise is hardest when performed off      of floor.              Side Bridge    ,

Execution          Turn torso to one side while keeping arms straight and perpendicular      to torso throughout movement.      Return weight back over shoulders by rotating torso to original      position. Continue lowering weight to opposite side. Repeat.        Comments          Both arms should be kept straight and perpendicular to torso.      Hips should also be kept nearly straight, only slightly bent.      See Spot Reduction      Myth.      \u00a0      This movement involves both spinal      rotation and hip external      rotation. Because leg to the opposite side of added weight      acts to counter weight's resistance, greatest downward force      onto floor is placed on foot nearest side of added weight. Since      foot of near leg provides more secured base of support, external      rotation of near hip provides significantly more torque as compared      to relatively passive internal rotation of far hip.    ,

Roll body down      and lie with back on ball, hips nearly straight, and feet apart      on floor. Hold onto dumbbell with both hands with arms extending      straight upward.        Execution          Turn torso to one side while keeping arms straight and perpendicular      to torso throughout movement.      Return dumbbell back over shoulders by rotating torso to      original position. Continue lowering dumbbell to opposite side.      Repeat.        Comments          Both arms should be kept straight and perpendicular to torso.      Hips should also be kept nearly straight, only slightly bent.      See Spot Reduction      Myth.      \u00a0      This movement involves both spinal      rotation and hip external      rotation. Because leg to the opposite side of dumbbell acts      to counter weight of dumbbell's resistance, greatest downward      force onto floor is placed on foot nearest to side of dumbbell.      Since foot of near leg provides more secured base of support,      external rotation of near hip provides significantly more torque      as compared to relatively passive internal rotation of far hip.    ,

This movement arguably involves more hip internal      rotation and transverse      adduction than spinal      rotation.

A large      part of rotational force actually occurs through rotation/transverse      adduction of forward hip. Because rear leg is only supported      by forefoot, hip of forward leg is utilized much greater than      hip of rear leg since forward leg offers more secured base of      support.

Roll body down and lie with back on ball, hips      nearly straight, and feet apart on floor. Hold onto stirrup with      both hands with arms extending straight upward.        Execution          Allow resistance from cable to turn torso downward, toward      direction of pulley while keeping arms straight and perpendicular      to torso throughout movement. Pull stirrup in an arch over shoulders      by rotating torso to opposite direction of pulley until cable      makes contact with shoulder. Return to original position in opposite      direction and repeat. Continue with opposite side.        Comments          Both arms should be kept straight and perpendicular to torso.      Hips should also be kept nearly straight, only slightly bent.      Also see other      view.      \u00a0      This movement involves both spinal      rotation and hip external      rotation. Because leg furthest from pulley acts to counter      weight of cable's resistance, greatest downward force onto floor      is place on foot closest to pulley. Since foot of near leg provides      more secured base of support, external rotation of near hip provides      significantly more torque as compared to relatively passive internal      rotation of far hip.      \u00a0      Continued rotation would occur through spine except when      cable makes contact with body precluding further movement and      resistance would no longer be provided through cable since line of force is      no longer perpendicular line of pull. Seated oblique exercises      or those exercises where hips are stabilized, allow for greater      range of movement through spine. See Spot      Reduction Myth.    ,

Grasp barbell to sides. Dismount bar from      rack and back up until contact is made with box immediately behind.      Stand with wide stance with feet flared out slightly.        Execution          Sit back onto box by bending hips back while bending knees,      keeping shins nearly perpendicular or knees slightly behind ankles.      Lower rear end back onto box in controlled manner. Rock torso      back slightly. Once torso rocks forward, immediately stand back      up rapidly by driving hips upward, keeping knees above ankles      and chest high until legs are straight. Return and repeat.        Comments          Try to keep knees from traveling forward while reaching rear      end back onto squat box. Ideally, knees could be behind ankles.      In this position, greater stretch reflex can be created through      hips (via hamstrings)      once torso rocks forward just before squat. However, other hip extensors      can engage in stretch-shortening      cycle (although to lesser extend in this position) in lieu      of hamstrings' optimized involvement.      \u00a0      Box Squat is said to build explosive strength by breaking      eccentric/concentric chain as experienced in Barbell      Squat. However, stretch-shortening cycle still occurs through      altered exercise mechanics as explained above.      \u00a0      Adjustable safety bars on power rack should be positioned      slightly below lowest position of barbell in case of fail. Box's      height could allow pivot point of hips to travel slightly lower      than pivot point of knee, however, programmed partials      can be performed on higher box. Rubber mats can be stacked on      top of box to adjust to intended height. Box can be orientated      diagonally so corners can be straddled, so box is more directly      under hips in standing position.      \u00a0      Do not fall on to or bounce off of box. Keep head facing      forward, back straight and feet flat on floor. Keep knees apart      so thighs point same direction as feet throughout movement. Involvement      of Quadriceps and Soleus are limited since shin is kept nearly      vertical.      \u00a0      During 1960s, Box squats (then called Rocking Box Squats)      were first popularized by Olympic hammer thrower and power lifter      George Frenn (Boyle 2010). Box Squats were later popularized      by Louie Simmons.      Dozens of variations are used by powerlifters and athletes using      Louie Simons' Westside      Barbell Program.    ,

Grasp cable rope attachment with      both hands. Place wrists against head. Position hips back and      flex hips, allowing resistance on cable pulley to lift torso      upward so spine is hyperextended.        Execution          With hips stationary, flex waist so elbows travel toward      middle of thighs. Return and repeat.        Comments          Note movement occurs in waist, not hips. See Spot      Reduction Myth. Hyperextension of spine at top of motion      is achieved by anterior rotation of pelvis with flexed hips.      Certain individuals may need to keep their neck in neutral position      with space between their chin and sternum. If two soft stirrups      are used instead of rope attachment, grasp stirrups at side of      head. Also see alternative      technique.

Although many more articulations are used in      climbing, only most commonly used movements to raise body weight      (eg: hip extension) or larger body segments (eg: hip flexion)      are listed.    ,

Execution 1          As kettlebell rises vertically in front of chest, pull kettlebell      inward slightly and quickly release grip. Immediately rotate      wrists while pointing bent elbows downward. As kettlebell begins      to fall back down, grasp kettlebell handle with both hands with      underhand grip. Immediately bend over at hips while bending knees.      Allow arms to straighten and forearms to make contact with inner      thighs while kettlebell swings back under hips.        Execution 2          As kettlebell rises vertically in front of body, pull kettlebell      inward slightly, quickly release grip, and switch grip back by      grasping with overhand grip. Immediately bend over at hips while      bending knees. Allow arms to straighten and forearms to make      contact with inner thighs while kettlebell swings back under      hips. Continue to swing kettlebell downward and upward switching      between over and underhand grips.        Return          Swing kettlebell back down between legs. Allow kettlebell      to swing forward but do not extend hips and knees (as would be      required to continue the swing). Slow kettlebell's swing and      place on floor in original deadlift posture.        Comments          Exercise emphasizes hand-eye coordination. A less challenging      movement can be practiced by switching grips of only one hand      at a time, so at least one hand grips kettlebell at all times.      For example, grip would transfer from overhand, to mixed, to      underhand, to mixed, and back to overhand.      Keep back taut throughout swing. Dynamic shoulder and shoulder      girdle movements are largely passive due to pendulum effect.      Muscles driving other dynamic movements drive kettlebell upwards.

Return weights to floor      by bending hips back while allowing knees to bend forward, keeping      back straight and knees pointed same direction as feet. Repeat.        Comments          Throughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders high, arms and      back straight. Knees should point same direction as feet throughout      movement. Keep bar close to body to improve mechanical leverage.      Grip strength and strength endurance often limit ability to perform      multiple reps at heavy resistances. Gym chalk, wrist straps,      grip work, and mixed grip can be used to enhance grip. Mixed      grip indicates one hand holding with overhand grip and other      hand holding with underhand grip. Lever      barbell jack can be used to lift barbell from floor for easier      loading and unload of weight plates.      \u00a0      In powerlifting, do not squat down too deep and keep shoulder      joint slightly behind bar for optimal leverage and mechanics      (think 'teeter toter'). Upper body will move back as weight is      pulled upward. On rep training, do not merely tap weight to ground,      but instead let barbell settle to ground each rep to sufficiently      train range of motion through initial slack of heavy barbell.
